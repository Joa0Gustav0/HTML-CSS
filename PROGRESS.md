14/05 - Today I reviewed some knowledges about programming logic. I've coded simple and unusual projects just for really reviewing. I'll keep like this tomorrow just for be sure I don't miss the mindset. I saw a lot of videos from different programmers n' they've inspired me to carry on! I hope next days I feel excited as I was today. I feel now is the moment.

15/05 - Today I started believing that now things are going on welly! I believe im correctly leading my mindset and I really hope now it's the time... I REALLY believe im following the correct path! I inted tomorrow to start learning a new language. I felt in love for HTML/CSS... N' why not? Thats wahat I want! Here we go! Im excited!

16/05 - Today was a "understandable" day. The same felling about the path im following! Finally started the HTML5 and CSS3. I have to create the habit of reading. I need to dive into what I want. I need to estimulate my mindset... I think that's it for today.

17/05 - Today was a really productive day. I am really diving into the things... I learned about the internet's history and how it works. It was a real plesure moment. And them, I finally prepared the tools for start coding. I am so excited for the other days.

18/05 - Today was incredible. A good advance. I felt so much happy because of all the new things im learning, and mainly because I felt the flavor of my autonomy. I am understanding perfectly what the HTML & CSS course is offering me. Im so much satisfied. Since yesterday, i feel so much like to watch MATRIX... I presume it's going to be a nice inspiration. I'm not sure I'll have time for studying tomorrow. I hope i have.That's it for today. Life is good! 

23/05 - Today I dont felt so much thing... My mind is a lil bit full of boring things... By the way, I keep following the same course and it's visible by myself Im having a big progress... I'ven't typed this days before, but since I started the course, most of the things the teacher is about to explain I already know it... Its a good motivation to me! I won't give up! 

‚≠ê 27/05 - Today I can say was the best one! Finally I finished the course's first module. Then, I've done some challenges just for testing my knowledges... And guess it... I GOT ALL OF IT! Im so proud myself! The sensation of done work is perfect! I've learned that weekends are awesome for long steps on my journey! That's it, honey... That's it! I will get it! 

29/05 - Today it was good... Or I'ld say normal... First my time was decreased by a boring homework I'd to do... By the way I studie the most  could... N' u know what, I just know Im in the right path. For sure Im going to have so much fun with CSS.. I tried to do somethings by myself... And guess what!!! I GOT IT! That's it for today... I home tomorrow for being more productive than today.

01/06 - Today was adorable... More than never Im more confident Im following the right path... I presume it's not going to take too long for getting "there"... I will keep learning until I can... I confess I felt a lil bit desmotivated today... But the felling of done work is incredible that made me feel thirsty for learning. I'm more than satisfied... Life has a long and 'flowerful' road! üåºüå∑üåπüå∏üå∫üåªüíêüåà

Then I could proof I've learnead so much new things by deving my first "concluded" website project!!! I am so happy by myself! By the way, Im really tired because I almost didn't sleep this weekend... That's it... I will keep going!

05/06 - Today I didn't studied so much... Telling the truth I basically didn't learn something new... Just reviewing... By the way, I'm more confident about myself, felling more even more connected to the subject, u know, honey... üêù‚ú®

06/06 - Today I'vent done so much things... However, the felling that I am getting somewhere remains, and it makes me even more confident to carry on... I've had my "first" contact with Git and GitHub... And it's kind interesting! I wanna know even more about it...
