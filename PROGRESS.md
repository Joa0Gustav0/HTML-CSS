üåàPROGRESS:

14/05 - Today I reviewed some knowledges about programming logic. I've coded simple and unusual projects just for really reviewing. I'll keep like this tomorrow just for be sure I don't miss the mindset. I saw a lot of videos from different programmers n' they've inspired me to carry on! I hope next days I feel excited as I was today. I feel now is the moment.

15/05 - Today I started believing that now things are going on welly! I believe im correctly leading my mindset and I really hope now it's the time... I REALLY believe im following the correct path! I inted tomorrow to start learning a new language. I felt in love for HTML/CSS... N' why not? Thats wahat I want! Here we go! Im excited!

16/05 - Today was a "understandable" day. The same felling about the path im following! Finally started the HTML5 and CSS3. I have to create the habit of reading. I need to dive into what I want. I need to estimulate my mindset... I think that's it for today.

17/05 - Today was a really productive day. I am really diving into the things... I learned about the internet's history and how it works. It was a real plesure moment. And them, I finally prepared the tools for start coding. I am so excited for the other days.

18/05 - Today was incredible. A good advance. I felt so much happy because of all the new things im learning, and mainly because I felt the flavor of my autonomy. I am understanding perfectly what the HTML & CSS course is offering me. Im so much satisfied. Since yesterday, i feel so much like to watch MATRIX... I presume it's going to be a nice inspiration. I'm not sure I'll have time for studying tomorrow. I hope i have.That's it for today. Life is good! 

23/05 - Today I dont felt so much thing... My mind is a lil bit full of boring things... By the way, I keep following the same course and it's visible by myself Im having a big progress... I'ven't typed this days before, but since I started the course, most of the things the teacher is about to explain I already know it... Its a good motivation to me! I won't give up! 

‚≠ê 27/05 - Today I can say was the best one! Finally I finished the course's first module. Then, I've done some challenges just for testing my knowledges... And guess it... I GOT ALL OF IT! Im so proud myself! The sensation of done work is perfect! I've learned that weekends are awesome for long steps on my journey! That's it, honey... That's it! I will get it! 

29/05 - Today it was good... Or I'ld say normal... First my time was decreased by a boring homework I'd to do... By the way I studie the most  could... N' u know what, I just know Im in the right path. For sure Im going to have so much fun with CSS.. I tried to do somethings by myself... And guess what!!! I GOT IT! That's it for today... I home tomorrow for being more productive than today.

01/06 - Today was adorable... More than never Im more confident Im following the right path... I presume it's not going to take too long for getting "there"... I will keep learning until I can... I confess I felt a lil bit desmotivated today... But the felling of done work is incredible that made me feel thirsty for learning. I'm more than satisfied... Life has a long and 'flowerful' road! üåºüå∑üåπüå∏üå∫üåªüíêüåà

03 & 04/06 - This days was so intense - In different ways of the word!!!- I've learned so much new things... I can say I really dived into the studying vibes... Then I could proof I've learnead so much new things by deving my first "concluded" website project!!! I am so happy by myself! By the way, Im really tired because I almost didn't sleep this weekend... That's it... I will keep going!

05/06 - Today I didn't studied so much... Telling the truth I basically didn't learn something new... Just reviewing... By the way, I'm more confident about myself, felling more even more connected to the subject, u know, honey... üêù‚ú®

06/06 - Today I'vent done so much things... However, the felling that I am getting somewhere remains, and it makes me even more confident to carry on... I've had my "first" contact with Git and GitHub... And it's kind interesting! I wanna know even more about it...

08/06 - Today I've done si many things... I have no much things to say... By the way, I can feel sone evolution coming in day from day... I'm too tired for writting... That's all for today!

17/06 - Hey, after a long time... I know I'ven't write something here for a while... But it was just laziness of writting... By the way, I've keept studying and practicing. I've done some more projects. And every day another I am learning more and more, recognizing my mistakes... And it's really good! And one more thing... Today, after a long time I am going to be game deving just for chill listening to some chaotic and dark playlist I've found on youtube...

19/06 - Okay... I assume I'ven't wrote here yesterday... But it's true I've studied! I've done two new projects "Just having fun"... One of these's reason for being done is because I already know that in the course it's going to be required. By the way... The most important thing that happened to me is that I found a really fabulous video ( Now it's saved on my heart) that unblindfolded me about the most critical point I was having about CSS... RESPONSIVITY!!! I can say after this video things are going to sound more pleasureable. I am happy, confort, confident and peaceful. That's my thing... ‚ò∫üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüå†ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

20 & 21/06 - I have to tell you... I am kind o lazy about starting a new course module... By the way, I do not stop exercising... I am doing some projects for reviewing and I am so happy finally I can say I learned HTML and CSS. That's it honey! Life is beautiful! I am tired... I need to reorganize my sleeping time... And I need to practice my non looking keyboard typing skill... I will find a way...

29/06 - Hey... After a some time I kicked out laziness and decided writing something in here! Yes, I am studying every single day! And I have to say... I am really getting the thing! I started learning JavaScript and I kind of mastering it! I know how to do the thing! It's awesome to feel I am following the right path! It's a real pleasure! I' ve done some exercises/challenges a couple of minutes ago... Two of it... And I have got it! I am so happy! I will finally sleep weel! Bye! üçÉ

22/09 - Hi... It's a long time since the first time I wrote something right here... By the way, today, as I did not have time to code or study, I decided to update this "diary"... Sharing my progress, last time I said I was starting to learn JavaScript and really getting there... And now, I can say I have learned it for real and I am programming every single day... Finishing my learning about JavaScript, I started studying React! And it's awesome... This lib is making me feel like a true programmer... I am loving it so much... A awesome thing I had contact and truly learned it, was how to work with APIs... It's a magical universe! And that's it... I really found a career for life... ‚ù§Ô∏è

30/09 - Hey... Hmm... I am not sure about what can I write here now... By the way, the unic topic I can even think and is relevant is about my React learning progress. I can say I really learned it! It's a awesome...

01/10 - Here I am, another day without programming... By the way, I presume tomorrow I already can start a new project - This is going to be my "first official React project". I am really excited for this, however, I am a lil bit no creative... Whatever... I will do it! You know, having in mind all of this is my future is so ambiguos, I love the sensation that I know what I want for my future, but,
I feel afraid about joining this "world"... But I know I will get it! Cheers for life! üçπ‚ú®

04/10 - I can not say I am proud about myself relate to my productivity... By the way, the previous days - Those I did not commit at least once - I felt bad, I got a fiver, and it made some things impossible to be done... I passed all the time on bed... Today I still felling some symptoms, however I presume tomorrow I will be 100% better, then, I can resume to the works! In addition, today I've started planning the "layout" of my new project. I can not say it was something really good, but it is not that bad... At least, I can say I have targeting for now... That's it for now! Bye!

05/10 - Hey... Another day without doing a single thing... Relate to my health, I still feel no good... All the days I try to produce the least I can... Whatever... I presume I really found a good design for my new project, so I am felling a little bit confident about this... I will get it! Wish me get well as soon as possible! I wiil get it! * listening to Tim Maia and Rita Lee * üòäüå¨

12/12 - Yess... Once more, here I am, writting something after a long time... I just can say I am very proud by myself. I am on a good progress...

And I love you! üå¨üçÉ
